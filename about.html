                        Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without
                        it, we’d have none of the most popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our
                        smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It
                        all runs on code.

                                    Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was born on 10 December 1815 27 November
                                    1852 was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles
                                    Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She
                                    was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
                                    calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by
                                    such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer
                                    programmer.

                            Programming is the process of creating the instructions that will tell the computer how to
                            perform a particular task given to it. You do this using programming languages
                            When we talk about programming, think of something like a remote control for your TV – it
                            will wait for you to give it instructions by pressing different buttons which then tell the
                            TV to perform a specific task (like changing the channel, increasing the volume, and so on).
                            Well, this is the same way programmers can instruct a computer to do various things.

                       We can define coding as the act of translating instructions for a computer from human
                       language to a language a machine can understand. This code tells the computer how to behave
                       and what actions to perform.
                       If you want to become a coder, you'll need to have some basic knowledge about programming
                       language(s). When I say programming languages, I mean languages like: Python, Java, Go, PHP,
                       or JavaScript, just to mention a few.
